This is a very simple web service for the MaxMind GeoIP database held at:

http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolite

The database structure is held in the docs table - it is pretty obvious which columns map to those in MaxMind's csv files.

The single API point is at /api/request/api/w.x.y.z where w.x.y.w is an IPv4 address. There is simple validation on this parameter and results are performed in json.
Return json array contains an 'outcome' that can be one of success, not found, or validation error.
